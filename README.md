# Description 

This repository contains an elegant prototype website developed using HTML/CSS, leveraging the Bootstrap CSS framework, and incorporating JQuery for dynamic DOM manipulations. The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes, and offers the flexibility to switch between Arabic and English languages. 

## Content
### Navigation Bar:
- The navigation bar features a sleek design with a transparent background, seamlessly integrating with the white backdrop to minimize clutter and enhance user experience. It comprises a logo positioned on the left, serving as a home page link, and six tabs: Home, About, Projects, Team, Contact, and Careers. The Team tab includes a dropdown menu with two options: "Board Members" and "Staff", with "Board Members" and "Home" being the functional tabs.
- The navigation bar is responsive, transforming into a button on smaller screens, which triggers a modal displaying the navigation links, while the Team dropdown collapses into a button for improved design in a modal context.
### Home Page:
- The home page features an automated sliding carousel, cycling through images every two seconds. Navigation buttons on both sides allow users to manually navigate through the slides, pausing the automatic rotation for approximately five seconds upon interaction. Quick navigation links are provided below the carousel for swift access to desired slides.
- The carousel is fully responsive, dynamically adjusting its size based on screen dimensions.
### Team Page:
- The Team page showcases a series of cards, each containing introductory information about a team member. Clicking on a card reveals further details in a modal, which can be closed by clicking anywhere outside the modal window.
- The layout of the Team page adapts responsively, with the number of cards displayed per row scaling based on screen size, ranging from a maximum of four cards per row to a minimum of one.

## Design
### Background Color (#ebeae5):
This soft, neutral hue serves as the foundation, providing a calming backdrop that doesn't overpower the content. Its subtle warmth exudes a sense of approachability and professionalism, making it ideal for creating a welcoming atmosphere. Additionally, the lightness of this shade ensures optimal readability of text and elements placed atop it.
### Link Color (#007bff):
The boldness of this vibrant blue hue injects energy and dynamism into the design. As the color of links, it commands attention and prompts user interaction, guiding visitors to important destinations within the website. Its high contrast against the background enhances visibility, ensuring that links stand out prominently without overwhelming the overall visual harmony.
### Text Color (#6c757d):
A sophisticated shade of gray, this text color strikes a perfect balance between readability and subtlety. Its moderate darkness ensures clarity of text across various screen resolutions while maintaining a harmonious relationship with both the background and link colors. This understated tone exudes professionalism and elegance, complementing the overall aesthetic of the website.
### Page Background (Gradient Background):
The gradient background adds depth and dimension to the overall visual experience. Transitioning smoothly from a warm, earthy tone to a lighter, more neutral shade, the gradient background creates visual interest without distracting from the content. This subtle gradient imparts a sense of sophistication and modernity, elevating the website's visual appeal while maintaining a cohesive color palette.

Collectively, these carefully curated colors work in harmony to create a cohesive and visually engaging website design. Each color serves a specific purpose, whether it's enhancing readability, guiding user interaction, or adding visual interest, ultimately contributing to a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience for visitors.
